        <p><!--A story about myself. Copyright: fengdasuk19@gmail.com-->
            Let me tell you a story(eh, the style seems like...Zhihu.com?).<br/>
            No, not a long story. Instead, a short one.<br/>
            <br/>
            When I tried to choose my university, I searched in zhidao.baidu.com
            using some questions as key words, when Zhihu.com didn't exist,
            in order to find whether there would be something I disliked in the school.<br/>
            I have seen EVERY best answer of the FIRST FIFTY pages of searching results.<br/>
            <br/>
            Don't you think it waste too much of my time? Part of the work IS, really.
            For example, if I could write all of my questions and searching in the web and download
            the answers when I sleep or have meals, then I would save more time for me so that I
            might have more time to search for more useful information and made a cleverer decision.<br/>
            <br/>
            I DID know this during my college days. But I didn't practice until today.<br/>
            Anyway, I've begun my tour. Will you be my friend? Let's fight for the same destination!<br/>
            <br/>
            Go!
